# The S.O.L.I.D Principles in Pictures
        =>
        1. S => Single Responseiblity (A class should have a single responsibility): if a class has many responsibility it increases chances of bug.

        2. O => Open-Closed =>  Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification (Goal: to extend a class's behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that class.)

        3. L => Liskov Substitution => To force consistency so that the parent class or its child class can be  used in the same way without any erros.

        
        4. I => Interface Segregation => Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use. (Goal: splitting a set of actions into smaller sets to that a classs executes only the set of action it requires.)


        5. D => Dependency Inversion => High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.(Goal: TO reduce the dependency of high-level class on the low-level class).


# DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself:
        => Avoid code Duplciation.
