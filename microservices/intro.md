# All necessary concept of java, golang microservices.
# What is microservices?
    => These are small, loosely coupled service that is designed to perform a specific business function and each microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.


# How do microservices work?
    =>
    Microservices break complex applications into smaller, independent services that work together, enhancing scalability, and maintenance.
    # How it works:
    1. Applications are divided into self-contained services, each focused on a specific function, simplifying development and maintenance.
    2. Each microservice handles a particular business feature, like user authentication or product management, allowing for specialized development.
    3. Services interact via APIs, facilitating standardized information exchange and integration.
    4. Microservices can be updated independently, reducing risks during changes and enhancing system resiliences.
