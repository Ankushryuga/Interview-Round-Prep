## OAuth2.0:
    =>
    OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows applications to obtain limited access to user 
    resources without exposing credentials.


## Key concepts of OAuth2.0:
    =>
    1. Resource Owner: user.
    2. Authorization server: Issues access tokesn after authenticating the user.
    3. Client : The application interface.
    4. Resource Server: Hosts the protected APIs.


## OAuth2.0 Flow in in Microservice Architecture:
    => 
    1. You have multiple microservices (e.g., ServiceA, ServiceB, ServiceC).
    2. A Gateway or API Gatway sites in front of them.
    3. An Authorization server(like OAuth0, Okta, Keyclock, or a custom server) is used.
    4. A Client(like a web or mobile app) interact with services.

## Step-by-step OAuth2.0 Flow::
    =>
    1. User Authentication via Client
      1.1. The user logs in via the client app (e.g., a single-page application or mobile app).
      1.2. The client redirects the user to the Authorization Server to authenticate.
    2. Access Token Issuance:
      2.1. After successful authentication, the Authorization Server issues an access token (and optionally a refresh token).
      2.2. This token is usually a JWT or opaque token.
    3. Client Calls API Gateway:
      3.1. The client sends (HTTP, gRPC, or graphQL) requests to the API Gateway, attaching the access token in the Autherization header.
          => Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    4. API Gateway validate token:
        4.1. API Gateway validates the token, if its a JWT, it verifies the token signature using a public key(e.g, from a JWKS endpoint)
        4.2. If it's opaque, it calls the Authorization server's introspection endpoint.
    5. Gateway Forwards Requests to Microservices:
        5.1. Once validated, the gateway can, forward the request to the appropriate microservice., optionally include user identity and claims (e.g., roles user ID) in a header like X-User-Id.
    6. Microservice Enforce Authorization:
        6.1. Each microservice, extract user identity and claim from the token(or from headers).
        6.2. Enforces fine-grained authorization based on user roles, scopes or permissions.
        6.3. Optinoally re-validates the token if not relying solely on the gateway.



# üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
    => 
    1. HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.
    2. Token Expiration: Short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens.
    3. Token Storage: Store tokens securely in client apps (e.g., avoid localStorage in web apps).
    4. Scopes and Roles: Use token scopes or roles for fine-grained access control.
    5. Rate Limiting & Throttling: Protect services from abuse.
    


# üìå Example Use Case
System:
Authorization Server: Keycloak
Client: React app
Microservices: AuthService, ProductService, OrderService
Gateway: NGINX with Lua plugin or API Gateway with token validation

# Flow:
React app redirects user to Keycloak.
Keycloak authenticates and sends back a JWT.
React app sends requests with JWT to API Gateway.
API Gateway validates JWT, forwards request to ProductService.
ProductService uses claims in JWT (e.g., role=admin) to allow/deny operations.






#### NOTE VVI: Service-to-service Communication..
    => Sometime microservices talk to each other, you have 2 options:
    Option 1: Propagate the User's token:
        1.1. Forward the original access token b/w services.
        1.2. Use it to maintain user context and authorization.
    Option 2: Client Credential Flow:
        2.1. Use the OAuth2.0 client credentials grant b/w services.
        2.2. Each service has its own credentials to obtain a service-level token.



| Component     | Responsibility                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Client        | Gets access token                      |
| Auth Server   | Issues and validates tokens            |
| Gateway       | Authenticates token and routes traffic |
| Microservices | Authorize and process requests         |



## When using a mix of HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL in a microservices architecture, the OAuth 2.0 flow remains conceptually the same, but how the access token is passed and validated depends on the protocol and client implementation.
    =>
    üéØ High-Level Architecture
        1. Client (e.g., web or mobile app) gets an access token from the Authorization Server.
        2. This token is passed along in requests to:
            2.1. HTTP REST endpoints  
            2.2. gRPC services
            2.3. GraphQL APIs
        3. Each service validates the token (or relies on a gateway to do it) and enforces authorization.

# üîÅ Unified OAuth 2.0 Flow (Protocol-Agnostic)
    1. User logs in via client ‚Üí gets an access token from the Auth Server.
    2. Client stores token securely (e.g., in memory or secure storage).
    3. Client includes token in requests to your services:
        3.1. HTTP: in Authorization header
        3.2. gRPC: via metadata
        3.3. GraphQL: in headers or variables
    4. Gateway or service validates token using:
        4.1. JWT validation (public key)
        4.2. Or token introspection (for opaque tokens)
    5. Service authorizes request using token claims (roles, scopes, etc.)


## Protocol-Specific Details:
    1. HTTP REST     
        1.1. Token Location: HTTP Authroization header
            GET /orders HTTP/1.1
            Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        1.2. Validation:
            - At API Gateway
            - Or Each Service(if there's no central gateway)
            
    2. gRPC Services:
        2.1. gRPC uses metadata for sending auth tokens
        2.2. Token Location: Authorization metadata in the gRPC request.
        2.3. Client Example:
            metadata.NewOutgoingContext(ctx, metadata.Pairs("authorization", "Bearer <access_token>"))
        2.4. Server middleware:
            - Interceptor checks the token in the metadata.
            - validates JWT or introspects token
        2.5. Use interceptors/middleware to centralize token validation.
    3. üß† GraphQL APIs
        =>GraphQL usually runs over HTTP (though it can be over WebSocket), so you treat it like a REST API.
        3.1 Token Location: Same Authrorization header as REST.
            POST /graphql HTTP/1.1
            Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        3.2. If using Apollo Server, token extraction is done in the context function:
            const server = new ApolloServer({
              context: ({ req }) => {
                const token = req.headers.authorization || '';
                return { token };
              },
            });
        3.3. You can also pass the token in query variables (less secure):
           # graphql:
            query {
              user(token: "<access_token>") {
                id
              }
            }


| Approach                  | Description                                                | Pros                                         | Cons                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized (Gateway)** | Gateway validates token and injects identity into requests | Simplifies services, single point of control | Gateway is a bottleneck/failure point |
| **Decentralized**         | Each service validates token                               | Microservices are autonomous                 | Duplicates token logic, more config   |


Best practice: validate at the edge (gateway), pass claims to internal services via headers (e.g., X-User-Id, X-Roles).



üîê Internal Service-to-Service Calls
When microservices talk to each other (via gRPC, REST, or GraphQL), two options:

1. Propagate User Token
Service A forwards the user‚Äôs token to Service B.

Preserves user context across service boundaries.

2. Client Credentials Flow (Service Identity)
Service A uses its own credentials to get an access token.

Useful when Service A is acting on its own behalf, not the user's.

POST /token
grant_type=client_credentials
client_id=service-a
client_secret=...

‚úÖ Summary by Protocol
| Protocol      | Token Location              | Validation                | Notes             |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **HTTP REST** | `Authorization: Bearer`     | JWT decode or introspect  | Most common       |
| **gRPC**      | `Authorization` in metadata | Interceptor or middleware | More setup needed |
| **GraphQL**   | HTTP header or query var    | Context processing        | Same as REST      |



üöß Extra Considerations
Token Expiration: Use refresh tokens in the client or handle token renewal.

Scopes/Roles: Include in token and use for fine-grained access control.

Revocation: Short-lived tokens + blacklist support (if needed).

Multi-protocol Auth Middleware: Consider shared libraries across services for token validation.
